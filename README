Origins
=======

This is Masscat's original GDB debugger stub.  As far as I can tell, this code
is effectively abandoned, and so I've decided to sort've take it over... not
actually maintain it, since, frankly, I haven't a clue how it actually works,
but to at least clean it up and keep it building with the latest devkitarm.

Building
========

This is now a "normal" devkitARM project, so as long as your environment is
properly configured, a simple 'make lib' then 'make' should suffice.

Using
=====

I gotta write this section... it'll happen some day.  For now, nethackds is
a good place to look for example code (it's pretty straight forward, really).
